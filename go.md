## Experience
Most my Go experience is based on my work for [Aqua Security](https://www.aquasec.com/). It's one of the leaders of security market, providing both on-premise and cloud solutions for clients around the world.

Besides commercial product company contributes to open source projects and I worked along with open source support team.

## Trivy (2021 - 2023)
[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is a security scanner. Main goal of scanner is check app dependencies and find known vulnerabilities. It can scan docker images and app souurce code. Scanner is command line tool which makes it good fit for use with different CI/CD procedures.
As it's open source software all my changes are available for review

Here is list of pull requests I created:

I was also involved in client support (through github issues)

## Postee (2021 - 2023)
Postee was a notification app. It's essentially a webhook which receives events from another system and perform action according to configuration

Some of the actions available:
- create issue in Jira
- send message in Slack
- send message in Teams
- create issue in Service Now

App is not in active development at the moment though you can see my historical pull requests
